## Welcome to the Checkmate Homepage
Checkmate was written to give you a fast overview of your current diabetic treatment status (Based on your Nightscout cloud data).

This project is published as open source.

### Checkmate Features
- Visualize the daily GMI (Glucose Management Indicator) or average blood sugar level
- Visualize your daily "in Range" in percent (In range borders are configurable)
- Visualize the estimated HbA1c level over a 30 day period
- Visualize the "in Range" over a 30 day period
- Visualize the glucose profile over a day for an easy understanding of the GMI and In-Range values
- A notification informs you every day about your GMI and In-Range results

### Used Data Sources

**[Nightscout Project](http://www.nightscout.info)**  
Checkmate is using the Nightscout glucose data API to receive your raw glucose data and calculate and visualize the up- and downs of your current diabetic treatment status. Therefore a nightscout database is mandatory to run Checkmate. Follow the guide here to set-up a nightscout database [https://nightscout.github.io/](https://nightscout.github.io/).

**[XDrip+](https://jamorham.github.io)**  
I use the great tool XDrip with the Dexcom G6 to upload glucose data from my smartphone to the nightscout cloud.
This programm is not replacing any functionality of XDrip which can be downloaded at [Jamorhams Page](https://jamorham.github.io).
