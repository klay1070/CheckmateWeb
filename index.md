## Welcome to the Checkmate Homepage
Checkmat was written to give you a fast overview of your current diabetic treatment status (based on your nightscout cloud data).

### Checkmate Features
- Visualize the daily GMI (Glucose Management Indicator) or average blood sugar level
- Visualize your daily "in Range" in percent (in range borders are configurable)
- Visualize the estimated HbA1c level over a 30 day period (see detailed description below)
- Visualize the "in Range" over a 30 day period
- Visualize the glucose profile over a day for an easy understanding of the resulting GMI and In-Range result
- Remind you with a small Notification at a configurable time every day about your GMI and In-Range results for this day.
