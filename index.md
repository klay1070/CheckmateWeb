## Welcome to the Checkmate Homepage
Checkmate was written to give you a fast overview of your current diabetic treatment status (based on your Nightscout cloud data).

### Checkmate Features
- Visualize the daily GMI (Glucose Management Indicator) or average blood sugar level
- Visualize your daily "in Range" in percent (in range borders are configurable)
- Visualize the estimated HbA1c level over a 30 day period (see detailed description below)
- Visualize the "in Range" over a 30 day period
- Visualize the glucose profile over a day for an easy understanding of the resulting GMI and In-Range result
- Remind you with a small Notification at a configurable time every day about your GMI and In-Range results for this day.

### Used Data Sources

###[Nightscout Project](http://www.nightscout.info)

Checkmate is using the Nightscout glucose data API to receive your raw glucose data and calculate and visualize the up- and downs of your current diabetic treatment status. Therefore a nightscout database is mandatory to run Checkmate. Follow the guide here to set-up a nightscout database [https://nightscout.github.io/](https://nightscout.github.io/).
I use the great tool XDrip to upload glucose data from my smartphone to the nightscout cloud.
This programm is not replacing any functionality of XDrip which can be downloaded at [Jamorhams Page](https://jamorham.github.io).
